Covid Stats EU is a simple data analytics system for covid-19 activity monitoring and it's part of a collaborative university assignment in Web technologies course.

## Information

**This repository contains only the frontend part of the application.** For more information on the backend see [here](https://github.com/covid-stats-eu/covid-stats-eu-server). The frontend is completely static - it doesn't run on node or any other runtime, so you can just load the `index.html` file on your browser. We wanted to keep things simple :) You could also use the [Live Server vscode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for live reload features. It makes development easier.

## Development setup

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/covid-stats-eu/covid-stats-eu-client
```

Open `index.html` with your browser of choice.
